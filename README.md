# Supervised-Learning

This supervised-learning project use 5 different supervised learning algorithms which are K-nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Boosting, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machine. Running on 2 datasets, [Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29), and [Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/optical+recognition+of+handwritten+digits). Model complexity experiments and learning curve experiments are done for both datasets with each and every algorithms. Detail analyais report can be found in ychen3017-analysis file.

## Getting Started

1. The project is written in Python 3.6.3 Library dependencies are: 
- scikit-learn 0.19.1
- numpy 1.13.3
- pandas 0.20.3
- matplotlib 2.1.0
- graphviz 2.38.0

2. Datasets
- Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC): can be loaded from scikit-learn directly
- Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits (ORHD): 
	- test set can be downloaded from 
  ```
  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/optdigits/optdigits.tes
  ```
	- training set can be downloaded from 
  ```
  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/optdigits/optdigits.tra
  ```
	- please store in data folder after downloaded 

3. There are 10 python script files which names as combination of dataset and algorithm:
- WDBC_knn.py
- WDBC_DT.py
- WDBC_Boosting.py
- WDBC_NN.py
- WDBC_SVM.py
- ORHD_knn.py
- ORHD_DT.py
- ORHD_Boosting.py
- ORHD_NN.py
- ORHD_SVM.py

4. Figures and tables in analysis:
- All 22 Figures can be created by pythoon script directly
- All 4 tables are summarized by myself, but the number in all columns can be derived from python scripts


5. Others:
- some code has been grayed out, either they are not able to run with a final result or it will take long time to run
